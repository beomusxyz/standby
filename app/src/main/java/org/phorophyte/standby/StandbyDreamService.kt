/**
 * Standby as an Android screen saver.
 *
 * The system starts this on its own when the screen saver conditions are met, which for
 * most people means docked or charging, and it draws over the lock screen without the
 * user unlocking. That is the whole reason for it: MainActivity has to be launched by
 * hand, which is not how a docked phone should behave.
 *
 * ## Why this class has three interfaces bolted on
 *
 * DreamService extends Service but owns a Window, which makes it an awkward host for
 * Compose. Compose is a recomposition loop, not a view renderer, and it needs three
 * things from the view tree that an Activity supplies for free and a Service supplies not
 * at all:
 *
 *  - [LifecycleOwner] decides when to recompose and, more importantly, **cancels
 *    coroutines**. Every LaunchedEffect in StandbyDisplay is scoped to this. Without it
 *    the idle timers and refresh-rate effects never stop.
 *  - [ViewModelStoreOwner] is where `viewModel()` looks. Ours is separate from
 *    MainActivity's, so this gets its own StandbyViewModel. That is fine: the settings
 *    and the upload server live in AppContainer, so two ViewModels share one of each.
 *  - [SavedStateRegistryOwner] backs rememberSaveable. A dream gets no saved-state Bundle
 *    from the system, so this is mostly ceremony, but Compose requires the owner to exist.
 *
 * The registries are driven by hand from the dream callbacks below, then hung on the
 * ComposeView so everything underneath can find them.
